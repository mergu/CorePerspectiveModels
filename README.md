# CorePerspectiveModels

Adds a way to have different items in the hand and the GUI. Set pixels to alpha 253 for the texture in the inventory and 254 for the texture in the hand.
Use an item model to get everything in the correct position, and congrats! If you don't know how to change the alpha value, just play around with your favorite image editor.

Forked from ShockMicro's original CorePerspectiveModels shaders, updated to work on newer versions of Minecraft.
Uses Farcr's awesome Cleaver texture(s) as an example! Used with permission, of course. Fire Rod model was custom by ShockMicro.
